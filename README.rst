Features
--------

+ Scratch window automatically hides when inactive.
+ Mappings allow easy note taking and selection pasting directly into the
  scratch buffer.
+ Optional persistence across sessions.


Quickstart
----------

+ `:Scratch` opens a scratch buffer in a new window (by default using the top
  20% of the screen, configurable via `g:scratch_height`, `g:scratch_auto_height` and `g:scratch_top`).
  The window automatically closes when inactive (and its contents will be
  available the next time it is opened).
+ `gs` in normal mode opens the scratch window and enters insert mode. The
  scratch window closes when you leave insert mode. This is especially useful
  for quick notes.
+ `gs` in visual mode pastes the current selection (character-wise, line-wise
  or block-wise) into the scratch buffer.

Both above mappings have a `gS` variant that clears the scratch buffer before
opening it. Note also that the auto-closing features require `hidden` to be set
(and can be disabled via the `g:scratch_autohide` option).

By default the contents of the scratch window are lost when leaving Vim. To
enable cross-session persistence, set the `g:scratch_persistence_file` option
to a valid file path.

See `:help Scratch` for the full list of configuration options and more details
on each.
